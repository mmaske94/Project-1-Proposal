# Project Description
I will be building a Simon-like game. It is a game to test your memory. The game starts with nine differentt colored squares. As the game starts the game will flash one color. The user then will have to then click on the color that flashed. If the user is correct, then the game will flash that first color as well as a second. If the user chooses the first color and second color correctly, then it will go to three, four, five, etc... until the user cannot remember which color was next and clicks the incorrect color.
